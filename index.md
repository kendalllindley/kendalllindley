## Building skills

I consistently find myself needing to think through solutions that can be scaled. This site is an exercise of breadth. I want to learn what's out there and what's possible. It's nice to have you along.

## Challenges

I've had to wrestle with how to make things scalable for a web team that was working for one really big institution. Recently I've had the opportunity to see into the world of designing and marketing for hundreds of small businesses. It will be a whole new world, and I;m excited to see where it leads.

## What are we doing here

As I go through these adventures I am going to "blog" my personal experiments in front-end web development. I might also throw in some philosophy, project management thoughts, and anything else I may come across. This website is mostly for my own record. But hey, if it benefits a few others, all the better.

Enjoy.
